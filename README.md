# Content-Management-System
I have created this project as a demo project for a college website. It is a Django project for managing all the contents from the backend. I have made four types of users in this project, i.e., super admin, secondary admin, student, and visitor. Super admin has all levels of access. The secondary admin has limited access, which the super admin gives. Students have access to the student dashboard. Visitors can visit the website as regular users, but they don't have access to the other types of user dashboards. Visitors can see all the content that the admin wants to show them.
